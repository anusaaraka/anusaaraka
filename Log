     5. RELATIONS::
        ---------
        Modified: 
        i)    'rule182', 'kriyA-lupwa_prep_Pa', in the list of a condition of these rules 'above' and 'down' are added for the sentences like: 'This initial explanation given above refers to the ideal aspect of culture.'.
        i)     Modified saMjFA-samA rule.
      iii)   'kriyA_vi_vi', 'rule111' in these rules, the relation kriyA_viSeRaNa-viSeRaka has been modified as kriyA_viSeRaNa-kriyA_viSeRaNa_viSeRaka which is already there in our list.
       iv)   'rule109' the relation 'jyAxA-kriyA_viSeRaNa' defined in this rule has been mosified as 'kriyA_viSeRaNa-kriyA_viSeRaNa_viSeRaka' for the sentences like 'He runs more quickly.' between 'quickly' and 'more'.
        v)   'rule110' the relation 'jinameM-se' defined in this rule has been mosified as 'nirXArya-nirXAraNa' for the sentences like 'The doctors, many of whom are surgeons, were angry.' between 'whom' and 'many'.
       vi)   'rule85_3' somehow 'kriyA-dummy_subject' was being printed in this rule's print statement, that is deleted.
      
       Added  : 
       i)    vi-jo_samA, for the sentence 'The dog, who was black, barked loudly.'.
      ii)    Added new rule 'upameyopamAna_11' in link_relation_rules.clp file for 'Our program works better than yours.'
          type sentences.
     
      Deleted :
       i)     obj_kqxanwa_kriyA, in this rule 'object-kqxanwa_kriyA'relation is defined in the sentence "This is a sample sentence given by me." between 'given' and 'me' which seems redundant because this thing is captured by the next rule 'kqxanwa_kriyA-prep' which gives 'kqxanwa_kriyA-by_saMbanXI' relation between 'given' and 'me'.
      ii)    rule84, this rule defines 'sarvanAma-preposition' relation between 'to'(preposition) and 'whom'(wh-word) in the sentences like 'To whom were you speaking?' but a better relation 'kriyA-to_saMbanXI' between  kriyA 'speaking'and 'whom' bia to'(preposition) given by rule 'rule85_3', therefor this rule is deleted.
  
     6. Rule 'whose' in pada_ids.clp file has been modified for sentences like 'To which person were you speaking?',and added complex_prep-noun rule in pada_ids.clp file for handling complex prepositions.
     7. Databases ::

                Eg Sen: The shephered is tending the sheep.
      ii)   Added "a lot of        bahuwa_sArA     bahuwa_sArA     noun    2" in  samAsa-new.txt file.  
     8.   Added "get_hin_mng_list" and "vib_for_multiple_prep" in vibakthi.clp file .(for getting vibakthi meaning for multi-word prepositions)
     9.   Updated changes_in_databases file.
    10.   Modified 'wh-reorder1' 'wh_without_aux-reorder1' the condition '(not (kriyA_viSeRaNa-viSeRaka ?  ?wh_word))' in these rules has been modified as '(not (kriyA_viSeRaNa-kriyA_viSeRaNa_viSeRaka ?  ?wh_word))' because the relation '(kriyA_viSeRaNa-viSeRaka' has been modified as 'kriyA_viSeRaNa-kriyA_viSeRaNa_viSeRaka'in hindi_sent_reorder.clp file
    11.   Removed "wsd_mwe_mng" (In case of multi-word-expressions previously we use to Sort the group ids and assigning the           mng to the last id, but now we are using the head id information given  by the rule and assing the meaning to that           id ,(So we have removed this rule) and Modified "compare_wsd_and_db_MWE" ,"wsd_cmp_phrase_mng" and "cmp_phrase_mng"
          rules in hindi_meaning.clp file.
    12.   Updated verified, verified_output (519)

  ========

  1. WSD ::
     ---

And, (not (viSeRya-jo_samAnAXikar                                      aNa  ?vi ?id )) condition is added in this rule for relative clause constructions where                                      'that' should be translated as 'jo'.
                   3. Removed extra brace from the printout statement in young1 rule in young.clp file.

                   7. hate.clp: The condition which gives 'ko' vibhakti to the object of hate has been commented in rule 
                     'hate0' in 'hate.clp' file, because 'ko' vibhakti is attached by some other rule to animates objects.
                   8. cultivate.clp: Meaning sAMskqwika has been modified  as susaMkqwa during workshop (9-4-10).

                      coverage.and appropriate example is added.
        
       Deleted  : 1. rule167 and kriyA-vAkyakarma_4: these rules define 'kriyA-aBiprewa_kriyA' and 'kriyA-infinitive_vAkyakar                     ma' relation in 'I want her to know about it.' type sentences between want and know which is redundent
                     because this info is carried by the relation 'kriyA-kqxanwa_karma'.
        
        Moved   : 1. rule55: this rule is moved before ruel63, which also gives same relation 'kriyA-kriyA_mUla'.

                  1. det_and_sub, R_vi_and_obj, aBihiwa_sub_and_sub_samA, R_vi_and_sub, and_obj, and_to_inf: these rules 
                     have been deleted because the rule 'and_sub' and 'add_viSeRaNa_to_and_viSeRya' work for all these rules.
