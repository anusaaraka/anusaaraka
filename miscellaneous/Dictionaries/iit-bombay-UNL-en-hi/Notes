Steps to add dictionaries in GoldenDict
======================================
1.From Synaptic package Manager install the following packages
	goldendict
	dictfmt

2.In terminal enter goldendict
  ---> GoldenDict opens  (By default we can find Wordnet and English Wikipedia added)
  ---> To add any dictionary 
           |
           V
           ===>  Go to Edit --> Dictionaries -->Add --> Rescan now 
                 (Note:  Only path of the dictionary need to be added .)

3.Dictionaries need to be in Dictd File format
  For this we can refer:: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICT#DICT_file_format
  Dictionary should be in Key and Value pair.
  There should be ":" before and after the Key (ie. at the beginning of the line.)
  EX::   To add the word 'sculpture' with hindi meaning 'mUrwikalA', format should be as shown below
 	 :sculpture:mUrwikalA

4.Once the file is in Dictd file format following command need to be run :
	dictfmt --utf8 --allchars -s "My Dictionary" -j mydict < mydict.txt

         -->Where mydict.txt is the dictionary file that need to be added
         -->mydict is the name that is need to be displayed in GoldenDict.
         -->mydict.dict, mydict.index  files are created once the above command runs successfully.

5.Now the file is ready to Add in the GoldenDict.

6.shabdanjali is added from the data given by Chaitanya Sir. 'shabdanjali.dict.dz' is the file extracted from Star-Dict and    this can be added directly into GoldenDict. As GoldenDict allows the Star Dict format without editing anything.
      (Note: shabdanjali.dict.dz file needs shabdanjali.idx and shabdanjali.ifo file)

7.iit-bombay dictionary is copied from the 'UW-Hindi_Dict-20090403.txt'.
         -->Above file is modified in such a way that the pattern is as shown
                :English-word:Hindi-meaning  
                 Extra information
              EX:-  :auntie:मौसी
		    (icl>mother's sister)
		    (Noun,   Female   ,Animate   ,For nouns ending with  I  ) <H,0,0>;
          -->UW-Hindi_Dict-20090403.txt file originally contains the above information like this
                [मौसी] {} "auntie(icl>mother's sister)" (N,FEMALE,ANIMT,NI) <H,0,0>;
                The Ontologies like ANIMT, N, NI etc full forms are extracted from 
		  --->  2011_01_31_Ontology_Developed_by_IIT-B_384.doc
                  --->  http://tdil.mit.gov.in/pdf/Vishwabharat/tdiljan2002.pdf (pg.83-86)
   		These Ontologies are mapped in Ontology.lex file.
                        Ex:  ANIMT is mapped as Animated .
           -->Mapped file is passed as i/p for step-4. '
                  (NOTE:: I/p: file is 'iit-bombay.txt'. Any changes done in this should be compiled with flex file,                                        Ontology.lex and this output is passed to Step-4.
                          Programs are available in src folder.)


***Any modifications to be done in iit-bombay dictionary should be done in iit-bombay.txt1 which is in src/ and Step 4 need to be followed.
