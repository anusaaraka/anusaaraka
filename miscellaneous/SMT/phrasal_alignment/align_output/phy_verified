We see leaves falling from trees and water flowing down a dam.
How does the position change with time? 
Displacement has both magnitude and direction.
The average velocity can be positive or negative depending upon the sign of the displacement.
The velocity of an object, in general, changes during its course of motion. 
This was a problem even in Galileo's time.
This product is called impulse.
This property of the body is called inertia.
This reading T 1 is the temperature of the surroundings. 
This relationship is known as ideal gas law.
This represents a simple harmonic motion.
This shows the advantage of introducing the concept of rms values.
This suggests the definition of dipole moment.  
This product is a vector. 
This process is instantaneous.
This process is known as modulation.
More precisely , a is the acceleration of the center of mass of the system .
The length of each side is a scalar and the perimeter is also a scalar.
