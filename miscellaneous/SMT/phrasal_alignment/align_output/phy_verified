We see leaves falling from trees and water flowing down a dam.
How does the position change with time? 
Displacement has both magnitude and direction.
The average velocity can be positive or negative depending upon the sign of the displacement.
The velocity of an object, in general, changes during its course of motion. 
This was a problem even in Galileo's time.
This product is called impulse.
This property of the body is called inertia.
This reading T 1 is the temperature of the surroundings. 
This relationship is known as ideal gas law.
This represents a simple harmonic motion.
This shows the advantage of introducing the concept of rms values.
This suggests the definition of dipole moment.  
This product is a vector. 
This process is instantaneous.
This process is known as modulation.
More precisely , a is the acceleration of the center of mass of the system .
The length of each side is a scalar and the perimeter is also a scalar.
Communication is the act of transmission of information.
A simple method for estimating the molecular size of oleic acid is given below.
We can broadly describe physics as a study of the basic laws of nature and their manifestation in different natural phenomena.
By the nineteenth century, enough evidence had accumulated in favor of atomic hypothesis of matter.
However, atoms on a whole are electrically neutral.
Therefore, an atom must also contain some positive charge to neutralise the negative charge of the electrons. 
But what is the arrangement of the positive charge and the electrons inside the atom?
In other words, what is the structure of an atom?
The spectrum appears as a series of bright lines.
In such gases, the average spacing between atoms is large.
